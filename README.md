# Project Title

Ballpark Housing

## Overview

Ballpark Housing is an AI-powered web application that helps real estate professionals access, underwrite, and develop real estate projects.

### Problem Space

Canada is currently experiencing a housing crisis.
Renters are unable to find affordable homes because there's a supply gap.
This gap exists because Developers do not build as quickly as they should.

The bottleneck is caused by 3 major factors:

- Finding lots is an antiquated process that take months.
- Developers work with partial data because real estate development require domain knowledge that it is currently not cohesive and domiciled in one place.
- Building and Development permits are not streamlined and can take months to receive approvals.

This application aims to increase housing supply by helping real estate developers find lots, get into the right ballpark and build quicker.

### User Profile

Mom & Pop Developers

- looking for lots/deals that suit their development profile and risk appetite.
- do not have the resources that big firms have to hire multiple analysts to find and underwrite deals.
- are not knowledgebale about city plans, permitting processes and requirements.

Boutique Real Estate firms

- have some resources and want to find lots faster in order to develop more projects.
- spend months analysing and underwriting deals and so take several months to develop a project.

### Features
